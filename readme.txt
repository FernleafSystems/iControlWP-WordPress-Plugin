== Description ==

The [iControlWP Secure WordPress Manager](http://www.icontrolwp.com/?src=icwp_readme) is the only solution you need to
manage all your WordPress websites.

You're serious about WordPress Management, so we don't restrict you on features and tiers like "Pro" and "Business" - you can pick and choose exactly what you need.

*Our Mission - Better WordPress Management with Fewer WordPress Plugins*

With iControlWP you need fewer WordPress plugins on your sites because you can centrally manage much more from within your
control panel. For example:

*	You don't need an extra plugin for Google Analytics tracking codes.
*	You don't need an extra plugin for CloudFlare integration and management
*	You don't need an extra plugin to optimize your databases
*	You don't need an extra plugin to clean up old drafts, comments and post revisions
*	You don't need an extra plugin to manage WordPress automatic updates

With iControlWP you can:

*	Manage ALL WordPress websites from a single, centralized control panel.
*	One-click update WordPress Plugin (premium ones too!), Themes, and the WordPress Core.
*   Bulk update all plugins, themes and WordPress cores.
*   Very finely tune WordPress Automatic Updates for every plugin on every site.
*   Manage CloudFlare settings using our unique CloudFlare integration.
*   Insert Google Analytics Tracking code.
*	[Clean up WordPress](http://www.icontrolwp.com/2012/07/optimize-clean-up-wordpress-worpit/?src=wpt_readme)
and [Optimize WordPress databases](http://www.icontrolwp.com/2012/07/how-to-optimize-wordpress-databases-with-worpit/?src=wpt_readme)
*	Manage WordPress Security setting across all your sites.
*	Install new WordPress websites automatically, anywhere you have cPanel web hosting
*	Automatically log into your WordPress sites without remembering your WordPress login details.
*	Collect useful visitor site statistics and view them directly from within your control panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is iControlWP Free? =

No, but you can try it out using our unlimited-sites free trial.

[You can sign up free here](http://www.icontrolwp.com/?src=wpt_readme)

= Is iControlWP secure? =

Yes! We take great care to ensure the integrity of the connection between iControlWP and your website.

All sensitive data is encrypted on our system so it is never human-readable by anyone.

See the next question for more in-depth explanation.

= I want more to know more about iControlWP plugin security? =

We take security seriously at iControlWP - prevention is far better than cure and we trust when you see what steps we
take to ensure the integrity of your website you'll know we taking the biggest steps to secure your site.

*	Each new plugin install creates a unique secure code that you must supply correctly to add the site to your iControlWP account.
*	When iControlWP and your plugin are connected, iControlWP creates a unique PIN code, encrypts with an MD5 hash and stores in
on your site. ONLY attempts to connect to your plugin that supply this correct PIN code will ever be able succeed.
*	We also take it a step FURTHER - each connection performs a unique hand-shake process (that you wont find in other similar products)
between iControlWP and your WordPress websites to ensure that no-one else, anywhere, can spoof your WordPress site. The plugin will **always**
check to ensure that the connection has originated from iControlWP.com. If not, the connection is disregarded completely and immediately.

= Will the iControlWP plugin slow down my site? =

Not a chance! We have the absolute SMALLEST plugin (compared to similar products of this type) around.

We install only the absolute necessary code, and when you need more, iControlWP's unique "Action Pack" delivery
system sends just what your site needs.

= How does iControlWP work? =

With the plugin installed and the connection setup to your own iControlWP account, the iControlWP system
will periodically ask your WordPress website for some information.  Currently we check:

*	WordPress Core update status
*	WordPress.org Plugins update status
*	WordPress.org Themes update status
*	Other server environment information that helps us to determine compatibility with the iControlWP system.
This includes things like PHP version, HTTP server type and version. You can review all this captured
information from within iControlWP and is useful as a handy reference.

We then take this information and display it to you on the iControlWP dashboard - then it's over to you and what you want to do with it.

= What is WorpDrive? =

WorpDrive is a new, [far more clever approach to WordPress backup and restore](http://worpdrive.com/?src=wpt_readme), 
and is a premium product available from with the iControlWP control panel.

It doesn't use FTP, Amazon S3, or any of the traditional painful approaches to website backup, 
and you don't need to buy/rent any other 3rd party storage service.

WorpDrive is an ALL-IN-ONE backup and restore system for your WordPress website and is a bargain at twice the price.

= Is WorpDrive free? =

No. WorpDrive is available for a small monthly fee.
